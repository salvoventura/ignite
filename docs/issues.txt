1.Topology can not be modified once the Fabric is instantiated with that topology.
2.Topology details can not be edited via fabric interface.
3.If topology is cloned, port numbering for any new Leaf/Spine will in correct.
4.In topology default pane, changing the default values will not take effect on the topology.
5.In topology, manual editing of port numbers is not validated. This may clash with port numbers generated automatically when new Leaf/Spine is added. User must take care to avoid duplicates.
6.For Spine Switches, both uplink and downlink ports are assigned from the same list (Eth1/1-Eth1/64).
7.Port numbering in topology will work correctly upto 64 Leaf additions. After that port numbers will be incorrect.
